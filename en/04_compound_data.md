# Compound Data and Error Handling

[← Previous: Control Flow](03_control_flow.md) · [Contents](toc.md)

Basic Next provides mechanisms to group data together and explicitly manage missing or erroneous values. It heavily favors explicit structures over hidden state or implicit nullability.

## Fixed-Size Vectors

A fixed-size vector stores multiple values of the same type sequentially. Vectors are defined by an element type followed by one or more dimensions inside brackets.

```basic
LET dimensions AS INTEGER[3] = [10, 20, 30]
LET grid AS INTEGER[2][3] = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

For function signatures, fields, and parameters, each dimension must be a non-negative integer literal. However, in version 0.3, local `LET` bindings can use declaration-time vector dimensions that are evaluated once at binding time:

```basic
LET n AS INTEGER = 4
LET values AS INTEGER[n] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Indices are zero-based, running from `0` to one less than the dimension. Accessing an index outside this range raises an `INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS` runtime error.

If you declare a vector without an initializer, each element is automatically assigned its type's default value:

```basic
LET values AS INTEGER[5]  // A vector of five 0s
values[2] = 42
```

In Basic Next, vectors have value semantics for assignments and parameter passing. Assigning a vector to a new variable copies all of its elements. The new vector does not alias the old one; modifying one will not affect the other.

## Value Types (`STRUCT`)

A `STRUCT` declares a small, composite value type with named fields. Structs cannot contain methods, static fields, constructors, or visibility modifiers (all fields are implicitly public).

```basic
STRUCT Point
    X AS FLOAT = 0.0
    Y AS FLOAT = 0.0
END STRUCT

LET origin AS Point
LET moved AS Point = origin
moved.X = 10.0
```

Like vectors, structs have value semantics. Assignment or parameter passing creates a complete copy of the field values. Changing `moved.X` in the example above does not affect `origin.X`. Structs have value semantics; class-style `NEW` and `RELEASE` are not used to manage them.

## String Indexing

Strings in Basic Next are UTF-8 encoded, and their contents can be read using zero-based indexing to access individual Unicode scalars (characters).

```basic
LET greeting AS STRING = "Hello"
LET firstChar AS STRING = greeting[0] // "H"
```

String indexing is read-only. Attempting to assign to a string index (e.g., `greeting[0] = "J"`) results in a static error. Accessing an index outside the string's length raises an `INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS` runtime error.

## Alternative Types and Absence

Basic Next does not allow variables to be implicitly null or missing. If a variable might contain an absence marker or an error, you must explicitly declare it using an alternative type with the `OR` keyword.

Basic Next provides specific singleton values to represent the absence of data:
- `EOF`: End of input. `INPUT()` returns `STRING OR EOF`; statement forms `INPUT target` and `INPUT "prompt", target` assign the same result to a target.
- `NA`: A missing observation or data point.
- `NULL`: The explicit absence of an object reference or pointer.

```basic
LET line AS STRING OR EOF = INPUT()
```

You cannot use a variable with an alternative type directly if the operation requires a concrete type. You must first test and narrow the type using the `IS` operator.

### Narrowing with `IS`

The `IS` operator tests if a value matches a specific alternative or singleton. When used inside an `IF` condition, the compiler automatically narrows the type for the corresponding branch.

```basic
IF line IS EOF THEN
    PRINT "Stream ended."
ELSE
    PRINT line
END IF
```

In the `ELSE` branch above, the compiler knows `line` cannot be `EOF`, so its type is narrowed to `STRING`, making it safe to use in `PRINT`. 

In version 0.3, if an `IF` statement has no `ELSE` branch and all of its branches unconditionally terminate (e.g., via `RETURN` or `STOP`), the type is automatically narrowed in the remainder of the block:

```basic
LET file AS FS.File OR Error = FS.Open("config.txt", FS.READ)
IF file IS Error THEN
    RETURN
END IF
// After the returning branch, 'file' is safely narrowed to FS.File
LET closed AS VOID OR Error = file.Close()
```

You can also test for `NULL` or `NA` using `IS NULL` or `IS NA`.

## Error Handling

Basic Next does not use exceptions for error handling. Fallible operations explicitly return their success value or a built-in `Error` object. 

The `Error` object provides standard properties: `Code AS INTEGER` and `Message AS STRING`. Functions that might fail indicate this by returning their standard type `OR Error`.

```basic
IMPORT HOST.FileSystem AS FS

LET file AS FS.File OR Error = FS.Open("config.txt", FS.READ)

IF file IS Error THEN
    PRINT "Failed to open file: " + file.Message
ELSE
    PRINT "File opened successfully."
    file.Close()
END IF
```

By returning `Error` as an alternative type, Basic Next forces the caller to explicitly check for and handle the error before accessing the underlying value, eliminating unhandled exceptions at runtime.
