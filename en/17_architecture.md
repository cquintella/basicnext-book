## Filesystem Access Policy with Optional Sandboxing

Basic Next keeps filesystem access explicit without forcing every program into a sandbox. 

Bein so, the default build remains compatible with ordinary operating-system permissions. Sandboxing is an opt-in artifact profile selected when the program is built or run.

### Two filesystem profiles

Without a sandbox option, the program uses the normal filesystem permissions of the process that launches it:

```text
bnc app.bn
```

This is the `unrestricted` profile. It does not mean that the process has superuser access. The operating system, **user account, container, and service manager still apply** their ordinary permissions. Basic Next simply does not add
directory restrictions in this profile.

The optional `sandboxed` profile records a filesystem policy in the compiled
artifact:

```text
bnc app.bn --sandbox \
    --read-root ./input \
    --write-root ./output
```

The sandboxed artifact is limited to its declared roots. A read root permits
reading files below that directory. A write root permits creating, truncating,
appending, renaming, or deleting files below that directory. Read and write
roots are separate so a program can consume input without being able to alter
it.

If the selected target cannot enforce the requested profile, the build fails.
It must not silently produce an unrestricted artifact.

### Artifact ceiling and execution policy

The sandbox profile is an artifact ceiling: the maximum authority recorded in
the binary. A particular execution may reduce that authority, but it cannot
increase it.

```text
effective policy = artifact ceiling INTERSECT execution policy
```

For example, an artifact may be built with read access to `input` and write
access to `output`. A deployment can run that artifact read-only or with all
filesystem access disabled. It cannot grant access to a different directory.

Execution restrictions may be supplied by the launcher or environment:

```text
BN_FS_POLICY=deny ./app
BN_FS_POLICY=read-only ./app
BN_EXEC_POLICY=deny ./app
BN_EXEC_CAPTURE_LIMIT=1048576 BN_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS=5000 ./app
```

Environment configuration is therefore a narrowing mechanism. It is not a
replacement for the artifact ceiling, and `BN_FS_POLICY=unrestricted` cannot
remove restrictions from a sandboxed binary. A value the runtime does not
recognise (for example `BN_FS_POLICY=bogus` or `BN_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS=abc`) is a
configuration error: the process stops before `Start` with `CONFIG_INVALID`
and exit status 2, on `bni run` and in a compiled artifact alike. Policy is
never silently replaced by the defaults.

The same policy model applies to `bni run` so that interpretation and native
compilation have the same observable authorization behavior:

```text
bni run app.bn --sandbox --read-root ./input --write-root ./output
```

### What “unrestricted” means

`unrestricted` does not promise access to every path. It means that Basic Next
does not impose a root-based policy. The process still runs under the host
operating system's account, ACLs, container, MAC policy, and other controls.
Programs that need stronger isolation can use a container, WASI runtime,
operating-system sandbox, or service-manager policy in addition to Basic Next.

### Runtime enforcement

Capability checks happen at the runtime boundary. `HOST.FileSystem` operations
must re-check the effective policy when they open, read, write, append, rename,
or delete a resource. Checking only during compilation is insufficient because
the policy can be narrowed after a process starts.

Authorization failure is distinct from other failures:

```text
EXECUTION_POLICY_DENIED  the policy forbids this operation
FILE_ERROR               the policy permits it, but I/O failed
TARGET_UNSUPPORTED_*     the selected backend cannot provide the operation
```

Closing a previously opened handle remains available after a policy is
narrowed, so a denied operation does not prevent cleanup.

### Sandboxed path handling

The sandboxed profile compares path components, not textual prefixes. A path
such as `/data2/file` is not below `/data`, and `..` cannot escape a root.
Symlinks, junctions, and other reparse mechanisms must be handled by the
target's filesystem APIs; a `canonicalize()` call followed by a later `open()`
is not sufficient on its own because the filesystem can change between those
operations.

Sandbox support is consequently target-specific. The implementation must use
directory-relative, handle-based, or equivalent race-resistant operations on
each supported platform. Unsupported platforms reject `--sandbox` rather than
downgrading to `unrestricted`.

### Policy precedence

The precedence is intentionally one-way:

```text
compile-time artifact ceiling
        ↓ can only narrow
execution policy
        ↓ checked at every HOST.FileSystem call
effective operation
```

The following outcomes are expected:

| Artifact | Execution policy | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unrestricted | default | Normal operating-system permissions |
| unrestricted | deny | No filesystem operations through `HOST.FileSystem` |
| unrestricted | read-only | Reads allowed; writes denied |
| sandboxed: `input`/`output` | default | Only declared roots are available |
| sandboxed: `input`/`output` | deny | Filesystem operations denied |
| sandboxed: `input`/`output` | another root | Cannot enlarge the artifact ceiling |

This design keeps the compatibility default simple while making stronger filesystem isolation explicit, reviewable, and impossible to enable or disable accidentally through an environment override.
