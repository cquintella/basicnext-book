# Memory Management

Basic Next 0.5.0 uses automatic reference counting (ARC) for class objects.
The runtime tracks strong references, releases them when bindings leave scope, and
runs a class destructor exactly once when the last strong reference disappears.

## Strong references and destructors

Assignment to a class binding creates another strong reference. `RELEASE` drops
one binding early; it does not force destruction while another strong reference
still exists.

```basic
CLASS Box
    PUBLIC value AS INTEGER = 7

    PUBLIC FUNCTION CONSTRUCTOR()
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION DESTRUCTOR()
        PRINT "DEINIT"
    END FUNCTION
END CLASS

FUNCTION Start() AS VOID
    LET first AS Box = NEW Box()
    LET second AS Box = first
    RELEASE first
    PRINT second.value
END FUNCTION
```

The assignment to `second` retains the object. Releasing `first` therefore leaves
`second` valid. When `second` leaves `Start`, the count reaches zero and
`DEINIT` is printed once.

## Weak references

A weak reference does not keep an object alive. Declare it with `AS WEAK` and
make the nullable state explicit:

```basic
CLASS Node
    PUBLIC next AS WEAK Node OR NULL = NULL
END CLASS

FUNCTION Start() AS VOID
    LET owner AS Node = NEW Node()
    LET observer AS WEAK Node OR NULL = owner
    RELEASE owner
    IF observer IS NULL THEN
        PRINT "expired"
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

When the last strong reference is released, every weak reference to that object
is cleared to `NULL`.

## `RELEASE`

`RELEASE` is valid for managed object bindings and for owned values such as
primaries, structs, and vectors. It is a statement on a binding:

```basic
LET number AS INTEGER = 10
LET name AS STRING = "temporary"
LET values AS INTEGER[] = [1, 2, 3]
RELEASE number
RELEASE name
RELEASE values
```

Element expressions are not bindings, so `RELEASE values[0]` is rejected. Close
HOST resources through their API (for example `file.Close()`) and then release
the owning binding. `DELETE` is not a 0.5.0 language keyword.

## Pointers and diagnostics

A region created with `NEW T[n]` is reference-counted exactly like a class
instance: every `POINTER TO T[]` binding to it is one strong reference, and
the region is freed when the last one ends. `RELEASE` on a pointer binding
means "drop **my** reference" — it never takes the region away from another
binding:

```basic
FUNCTION Start() AS VOID
    LET a AS POINTER TO INTEGER[] = NEW INTEGER[3]
    a[0] = 7
    LET b AS POINTER TO INTEGER[] = a    // two strong references
    RELEASE a                            // a is done; the region lives on
    PRINT b[0]                           // 7
END FUNCTION                             // b leaves scope: region freed
```

Passing a pointer to a function works the same way: the callee may `RELEASE`
its parameter without affecting the caller's binding.

Never touch a binding after releasing it. The validator and runtime diagnose
`USE_AFTER_RELEASE` (`p[i]`, `LEN(p)`, passing `p`), `DOUBLE_RELEASE`,
`NULL_POINTER_ACCESS`, and invalid bounds instead of silently continuing — on
both `bni run` and `bnc` artifacts.

The normative ownership and ABI contract is in
[`0.6.md`](../../../language/0.6/0.6.md#memory-model-arc). The implementation evidence
and conformance fixtures are tracked with the 0.5.0 release bucket.
